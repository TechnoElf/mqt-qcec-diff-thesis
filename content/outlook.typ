It may be possible to modify edit graphs using quantum identities to create further possibilities for matches and thus reduce the length of resulting edit scripts. This may improve the predictions of the application scheme.

The diff-based application scheme considers quantum circuits as lists of gates.
Information on the positioning of the gate is thereby lost.
A more physically accurate representation of the circuit may for instance be a two-dimensional grid where gates may be rearranged as long as the ordering of operations on individual qubits remains the same.

In the end, the real application schemes were the friends that were made along the way.
