= Conclusion
The proposed application scheme can speed up equivalence checking by up to 60% in the right circumstances.
In many other cases, however, it fails to provide any meaningful speedup or even significantly slows down computation by a factor of up to 400%.
While there is no apparent correlation between the easily analysable properties of the circuits and the runtime improvement of using a diff-based application scheme, a heuristic based on the gate count difference and quivalence rate manages to filter out most bad instances.
