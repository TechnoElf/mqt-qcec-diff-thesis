= Implementation
The aim of this work is to modify diff algorithms for their use in quantum circuit equivalence checking and to integrate them into @mqt @qcec.
Additionally, tooling for benchmarking these approaches against the state of the art is to be developed.
The following sections will explore the implementation thereof.

#include "implementation/algorithms.typ"

== Visualisation
Initially, a visualisation of the diff algorithms applied to quantum circuits was created to assess their usefulness in equivalence checking.
Additionally, this served as exercise to better understand the algorithms to be used for the implementation in @qcec.


== QCEC Application Scheme
The Myers' Algorithm was implemented as an application scheme in @qcec.


== QCEC Benchmarking Tool
As @qcec doesnâ€™t have built-in benchmarks, a benchmarking tool was developed to test different configurations on various circuit pairs.

=== Google Benchmark
The Google Benchmark framework was initially used to develop benchmarks for @mqt @qcec.

=== MQT QCEC Bench
As Google Benchmark lacked the needed flexibility, a new benchmarking wrapper around @mqt @qcec was developed.
