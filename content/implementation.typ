= Implementation
This section discusses the solutions developed in this work.
First, Djikstra's algorithm, Myers' algorithm and the patience algorithm are elaborated.
A pseudocode representation of the chosen diff algorithms is presented for this purpose.
Next, the development of a visualisation tool for edit scripts of quantum circuits, Kaleidoscope, is explored.
The adaptation of this code into a functional equivalence checking flow is also discussed.
Furthermore, the section presents the newly developed benchmarking framework for @mqt @qcec.
Finally, possible heuristics that can process edit scripts for improved performance are explored.
