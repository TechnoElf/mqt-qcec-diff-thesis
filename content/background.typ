= Background
This section presents an overview of the technologies and concepts used throughout this work.
Specifically, to understand the methods developed in this thesis, it is necessary to understand quantum computation in general as well as the methods for representing and manipulating quantum functionality.
Additionally, knowledge of the problems of comparing sequences of values and especially the @lcs problem is required.
All of these topics will be covered in this section.
The application of these to quantum circuit verification will then be discussed in the next section.
